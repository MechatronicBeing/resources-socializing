  > The author was contacted by email and agrees to release the prototype online and outside the original website (ncase.me) with a CC0 waiver.  
  > **Response from the author** : "Sure! I'd just warn that my simulation really isn't rigorous and is not based on any data whatsoever (this is the main reason why I dropped it). As long as it's clearly labelled 'old prototype from 2016', that's fine!"
